# Memory Video

## About the Project
Welcome to our page! We have developed a PWA for users to input multiple images on our website, Then we will create a video slideshow for you!
This service is great for if you and your family or friends have been on a trip recently and want to have a short custom video memory to share with others. We will tailor the video from how you started your trip to how you ended it. But we are definetely not limited to just trips. Upload any group of pictures and we will make a short custom video for you!!
Want to have a great video of your memories using just the pictures you have taken??
